# Components Architecture Overview

## Purpose
This document outlines the architectural principles, patterns, and guidelines for component development in the Keyz application. It serves as a reference for developers to maintain consistency and quality across the component ecosystem.

## Component Organization

### Directory Structure
```
src/components/
├── common/     # Shared, reusable components
├── features/   # Feature-specific components
├── layout/     # Layout and structural components
└── ui/         # Basic UI components
```

### Component Categories

1. **Common Components**
   - Highly reusable components used across multiple features
   - Examples: Button, Input, Modal, Card
   - Should be generic and configurable
   - Must be well-documented with TypeScript types

2. **Feature Components**
   - Components specific to business features
   - Examples: PropertyCard, DamageReport, MessageThread
   - May combine multiple common components
   - Should be feature-specific but maintain reusability within the feature

3. **Layout Components**
   - Structural components that define page layouts
   - Examples: MainLayout, Sidebar, Header
   - Handle responsive behavior
   - Manage layout-specific state

4. **UI Components**
   - Basic building blocks for the user interface
   - Examples: Typography, Icons, Spinners
   - Extend Ant Design components when needed
   - Maintain consistent styling

## Design Principles

### 1. Component Composition
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Break down complex components into smaller, focused ones
- Use container/presenter pattern when appropriate
- Keep components single-responsibility

### 2. Props Design
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Make props explicit
- Provide sensible defaults
- Follow consistent naming conventions

### 3. State Management
- Use local state for component-specific data
- Leverage Context API for shared state
- Implement proper state initialization
- Handle loading and error states

## Conclusion

This overview serves as a foundation for component development in the Keyz application. Following these guidelines ensures consistency, maintainability, and quality across the component ecosystem. Refer to specific component documentation for detailed implementation details.
