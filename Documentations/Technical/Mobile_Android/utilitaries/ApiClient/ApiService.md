## ApiService Interface Documentation

The `ApiService` interface defines the network API routes for interacting with the authentication and profile management endpoints in the Immotep application. By encapsulating these routes within an interface, `ApiService` provides a clear structure for handling authentication and user-related operations through HTTP requests using Retrofit.

### Overview

- **Purpose**: `ApiService` serves as the main interface for defining API endpoints related to user authentication (login, token refresh, registration) and retrieving user profile data.
- **Global Constant**: 
  - `API_PREFIX`: Used as a base path for all endpoint routes, making it easy to update versioning or base paths in one place.
- **Data Classes**: 
  - `LoginResponse`, `RegistrationInput`, `RegistrationResponse`, and `ProfileResponse` represent the request or response data models for various endpoints.
- **Annotations**:
  - Retrofit annotations like `@POST`, `@GET`, `@Field`, `@Body`, and `@Header` are used to specify HTTP methods, parameters, and headers, ensuring each function adheres to RESTful API standards.

### Benefits of Using `ApiService`

1. **Modularity**: Encapsulating routes within `ApiService` makes it easy to isolate API-related code and reuse it across different parts of the app.
2. **Scalability**: Additional endpoints can be added by defining new functions within `ApiService`, keeping code clean and organized.
3. **Easy Testing**: When testing, `ApiService` can be mocked, allowing developers to simulate API responses without making actual network calls.
4. **Consistency**: Use of the `API_PREFIX` constant enforces a consistent API version path across all endpoints.

### Usage

The `ApiService` interface is typically implemented by the `ApiClient` object, which provides an instance of `ApiService`. This allows for simplified access to all API routes in the app:

```kotlin
// Example usage of ApiService through ApiClient
suspend fun loginUser(email: String, password: String) {
    val response = ApiClient.apiService.login(username = email, password = password)
    // Process login response here
}
```

### Summary

The `ApiService` interface simplifies network operations by grouping related API routes for authentication and profile management. It contributes to code clarity, testability, and scalability, making it an essential component of the appâ€™s networking layer.
